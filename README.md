2016 AT&amp;T hackathon 

Our application's goal is to promote recycling in a fun and friendly competition through our social platform.  The app has the user scan the bar code of the item they are going to throw into a recycling bin.  Recycling is then tracked with a"tree" that grows as the user recycles. The user can compare their tree to their friends' and see just who is more eco-friendly, incentivising living greener and recycling more. Per the EULA, the app can collect the information of what each user is purchasing and present targeted advertisements. This advertising program can be opt in, and if the user opts in, they can receive benefits, such as coupons for products they order repeatedly, data incentives, and other in game credits. Public recycle bins equipped with our device can also offer these same benefits, promoting recycling even when the user is away from home (such as being on vacation in Las Vegas).
